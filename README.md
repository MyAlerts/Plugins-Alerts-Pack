General
-------

Plugins Alerts Pack is an extension made for euantor's [MyAlerts][1] plugin with the aim to add more alerts and events to be notified of, building an effective bridge between MyAlerts and the most famous and used plugins developed for MyBB. It's currently a beta and provides a simple alert for MySupport plugin, but I've planned to add more alerts basing upon your requests.

If you have any feature request, suggestion, or you want to report any issue, please let me know opening a new issue on GitHub. Your contribute is very important to me and helps me into making Plugins Alerts Pack more complete on every commit. 

Main features
-------------

At the moment, Plugins Alerts Pack comes with **3 additional alerts** bridging MySupport and MyNetwork Profile Comments plus a notification for subscribed threads and Forums. You can be notified:

* When someone marks your threads as solved or not solved, eventually technical or not technical if MySupport setting "Hide technical notices" is set to Off
* When someone posts a new comment on your wall (aka MYN Profile Comments), or when someone replies to a comment you've made on another user's wall
* When someone posts a new thread in a subscribed Forum or a new post in a subscribed thread (if setting is set to Instant notification via mail)

Do you want more?
----------

Of course I'm available to plugins requests, so if you want to integrate an existing plugin with MyAlerts but you don't know how, well I'm here to do it. Just open a new issue here on GitHub and I'll do my best to accomplish your request as fast as possible.
